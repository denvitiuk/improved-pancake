The aim is to build a very simple frontend and a very simple backend that talk to each other. In the frontend, I want to type in a Ukrainian meal and a German meal (for example Borsch and Currywurst). This should be sent to the API of OpenAi and with the right prompt, it should create a recipe that combines both. This should the be shown to me as the user in the front end
